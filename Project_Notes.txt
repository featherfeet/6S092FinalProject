Questions:
    - Do I need more than 180 degrees shift?
    - EP pin connections on the LNAs?
    - Choice of capacitors and inductors for the LNAs?
    - Filtering?
    - How to get 5V from 13.8V without creating RF noise?
    - Footprints with ground vias or not?
    - Need an attenuator to avoid damaging radio?
